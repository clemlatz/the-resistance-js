the-resistance-js
=================

A web-app to play The Resistance game on-the-go without the game deck.

This app won't allow you to play online with distant friends*, but if you are on-the-go with some friends and you don't have the game deck with you, it will replace it.

I mainly created this as an exercise to learn AngularJS.

Based on: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Resistance_(game)
